Preserve the aspect ratio when the window is resized.

Consider using Applicative like
  let comp = realToFrac <$> randomFloatR 0 1
  color <- GL.Color4 <$> comp <*> comp <*> comp <*> pure 0.6

Improve random color selection so we don't pick anything ugly or hard to see.

Consider replacing ReaderT and Environment with a "Settings" or "Configuration"
module.

Make functions pure whenever possible.
